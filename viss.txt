heap sort:

Heap sort is a comparison-based sorting technique based on Binary Heap data structure where we first find the minimum element
and place the minimum element at the beginning. 
Algorithm
1)Build a heap from the given input array.
2)Repeat the following steps until the heap contains only one element:
 -Swap the root element of the heap (which is the largest element) with the last element of the heap.
 -Remove the last element of the heap (which is now in the correct position).
 -Heapify the remaining elements of the heap.
3)The sorted array is obtained by reversing the order of the elements in the input array.

quick sort

QuickSort is a sorting algorithm based on the Divide and Conquer algorithm that picks an element as a pivot 
and partitions the given array around the picked pivot by placing the pivot in its correct position in the sorted array.
